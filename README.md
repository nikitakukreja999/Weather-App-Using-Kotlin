# Weather-App-Using-Kotlin

  There are a lots of weather application available in Google Play Store. There are free APIs available in the market to use them to get weather informations like Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Weather status, Time of Sunrise and Sunset etc. This project is for creating an android weather app using Kotlin in Android Studio.

  There are many websites you can get by searching on the Google which supply free weather Api, but 
I used API provided by OpenWeatherMap for implementation of this project. 

  For using this API, first we have to create an account on OpenWeatherMap.
